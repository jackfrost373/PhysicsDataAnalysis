### Welcome to the GW data analysis tutorial

For questions related to the material, please contact Melissa Lopez (m.lopez@uu.nl)

Pre-requisites: environment yaml [TODO]

- GW tutorial 1: in this tutorial we talk about the antenna pattern of ground-based detectors.
- GW tutorial 2: we introduce the basics on how to read, pre-process and represent real detector data. It includes PSD computation.
- GW tutorial 3 [TODO]: some times it is useful to generate your own simulations. We also introduce matched filtering.
- GW tutorial bonus track [TODO]: original redshift calculation.
- Slides [TODO]: small presentation to introduce the topic.
