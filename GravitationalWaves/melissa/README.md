### Welcome to the GW data analysis tutorial

For questions related to the material, please contact Melissa Lopez (m.lopez@uu.nl)

**Pre-requisites**: (Jupyter, conda)

**Instructions before class** For this tutorial is _highly_ recommended to install a new conda environment. `environment.yaml` file contains all the specifications. You can install the new environment simply by running `conda env create -f environment.yml -gw_class`. Once this is done you can add your environment as a kernel to Jupyter running `python -m ipykernel install --name gw_class`.

- GW tutorial 1: in this tutorial we talk about the antenna pattern of ground-based detectors.
- GW tutorial 2: we introduce the basics on how to read, pre-process and represent real detector data. It includes PSD computation.
- GW tutorial 3: some times it is useful to generate your own simulations. We also introduce matched filtering.
- GW tutorial bonus track: ET configuration - redshift as a function of the total mass.
- Slides [TODO]: small presentation to introduce the topic.
