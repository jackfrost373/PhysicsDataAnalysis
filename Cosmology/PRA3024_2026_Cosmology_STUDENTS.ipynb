Among these, a very popular one is the [**Metropolis-Hastings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) algorithm, which is what we will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, the algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "* Start with an $n$-tuple of parameters $\\theta_{\\rm old} = \\{\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\dots\\}_{\\rm old}$ (in our case $\\theta = \\{h,\\Omega_m,\\Omega_\\Lambda\\}$) and calculate the $\\mathcal F_{\\rm old}$\n",
    "* Propose a new set of parameters $\\theta_{\\rm prop}$, calculate the new corresponding $\\mathcal F_{\\rm prop}$. How you propose the new parameters is not essential as long as the probability of going from one set of parameters to the next is the same as the inverse: $P(\\theta_a \\to \\theta_b) = P(\\theta_b \\to \\theta_a)$. For this, we normally take Gaussian displacements with some (relatively small) standard deviation.\n",
    "* Compare the new and old likelihoods-priors:\n",
    "    * If $\\mathcal F_{\\rm prop} > \\mathcal F_{\\rm old}$, accept the step: $\\theta_{\\rm new} = \\theta_{\\rm prop}$\n",
    "    * Otherwise, accept with probability $P_{\\rm accept} = \\mathcal F_{\\rm prop}/\\mathcal F_{\\rm old}$\n",
    "* If accepted, $\\theta_{\\rm new} = \\theta_{\\rm prop}$ and record the step; otherwise, $\\theta_{\\rm new} = \\theta_{\\rm old}$ (no re-recording)\n",
    "* Update $\\theta_{\\rm old} = \\theta_{\\rm new}$\n",
    "* Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "The MC chain keeps going until the desired number of steps or, ideally, when a suitable convergence test, like for example the [Gelman-Rubin test](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/advstatcomp/monitoring-convergence.html), is satisfied.\n",
    "Today we will just set a limit to the total number of steps, but please feel free to implement and test your favourite convergence test!\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at equation (4), you can convince yourself that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathcal L_a}{\\mathcal L_b} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\chi_b^2 - \\chi_a^2}{2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is useful because $\\chi^2$ can be large, so we want to avoid the likelihoods evaluating to `0.` -- computers don't like dividing by zero, unfortunately)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with an $n$-tuple of parameters $\\theta_{\\rm old} = \\{\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\dots\\}_{\\rm old}$ (in our case $\\theta = \\{h,\\Omega_m,\\Omega_\\Lambda\\}$) and the corresponding chi squared $\\chi_{\\rm old}^2$ (to be clear, for us this implies calculating a series of 580 integrals and comparing each with the observed values)\n",
    "* Propose new parameters $\\theta_{\\rm prop}$ and calculate the corresponding chi squared $\\chi_{\\rm prop}^2$\n",
    "* Draw a random number $r \\in [0,1]$\n",
    "* Accept the step if\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r < \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\chi_{\\rm old}^2 - \\chi_{\\rm prop}^2}{2}\\right) \\frac{P(\\theta)_{\\rm prop}}{P(\\theta)_{\\rm old}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "* If accepted, update $\\theta_{\\rm old} = \\theta_{\\rm prop}$, and record; otherwise, $\\theta_{\\rm new} = \\theta_{\\rm old}$ (no re-recording)\n",
