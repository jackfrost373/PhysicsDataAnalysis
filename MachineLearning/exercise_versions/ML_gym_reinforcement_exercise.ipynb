    "# When an agent performs a certain action in the current enviroment, GYM returns\n",
    "#  - a _reward_ for a certain result of performing the action in the environment\n",
    "#    (in case of cartpole: +1 if it didn't die.)\n",
    "#  - the new _state_ of the environment after performing said action\n",
    "#    (in case of cartpole: the effect of gravity pulling on the pendulum's top, on the angle, in one time step)\n",
    "#  - a 'terminal' in case the state is such that the agent cannot continue (is 'dead')\n",
    "#    (in case of cartpole: if the angle exceeds > 5 degrees of tipping over, or it flies off-screen)\n",
    "\n",
    "# It is up to us to make an agent that learns which action to take in which state, to maximise the total reward before it dies.\n",
    "#  We do this by 'remembering' what the results were of certain actions on certain states in a memory (i.e. a list or deque),\n",
    "#  And after every 'death' we sample ('replay') from this memory to train a neural network that decides the best actions\n",
    "#   we can take on any state we've encountered so far, which maximises the total reward.\n",
